Optamos por realizar el análisis multivariado asociado a la correlación de las variables numéricas. Se ve una clara correlación entre los puntajes de todas las pruebas y el GPA, lo que es relativamente esperable (puede haber una variable no observable relacionada a la intelegencia o el estudio).

Vemos que hay una gran concentración de personas que en la prueba de cienciatienen puntajes menores a 5. Otras asignaturas se ven un poco más normalmente distribuidas por sobre el 4, por ejemplo en el caso de matemáticas se ve que no hay muchos alumnos con notas menores a 4. Para hacer el análisis más preciso podemos simplemente ver el promedio de los alumnos en cada asignatura, donde observamos que la peor de ellas es ciencia, seguido por historia. Esto es consistente con el análisis que se puede hacer de manera gráfica, aunque puede ser un poco más simple evaluar con el promedio que con la frecuencia (de todas formas, no deja de ser información que puede ser valiosa, respecto a la distribución)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PtnBYR8vs0e7"},"source":["### 1.4.2 Otras Visualizaciones"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4f1PIBgMDt5H"},"source":["Genere dos visualizaciones extras que encuentre interesantes con estos datos.
